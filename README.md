### [Snake/ranking plot](https://weijia-ren.github.io/PIAAC-snake-plot/)

The "snake/ranking plot" can be used to visualize the estimates and the associated confidence interval of a group of observations/cases. The order could be sorted ascending or descending, and the whether the confidence intervals overlap or not would indicate whether the estimates from the two observations/cases are significantly different or not.
